**I have stopped the development of this plugin until further notice. This plugin hasn't been tested with Wordpress 2.7 so I am not sure how it behaves with that release.**

Comment Highlighter is a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) plugin which can be used to add different style classes to comments. There are already plugins/hacks/alterations that adds a style to all comments written by the blog owner, adds a different style to every other comment, etc. This plugin takes it a bit further.

Depending on which rules you set up, then Comment Highlighter can add style to comments based on the email of the author (of the comment), the name or the URL. These styles can furhter more be locked to a specific post ID.

Some samples of what **I** use this plugin for:

> ![http://famfamfam.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/tick.png](http://famfamfam.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/tick.png) Add a special CSS style to all comments written by my co-author (read: my wife ![http://famfamfam.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/emoticon_tongue.png](http://famfamfam.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/emoticon_tongue.png) )

> ![http://famfamfam.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/tick.png](http://famfamfam.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/tick.png) Add a special CSS style to all comments by a specific person on a specific post

> ![http://famfamfam.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/tick.png](http://famfamfam.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/tick.png) Add a special CSS style to all pingbacks

There might be other [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) plugins that does the same as this one, but I wasn't able to find any. At least not a single plugin that did everything.
