Fixed a minor issue with the "Add new comment highlight" button only showing up if there are at least one comment highlight. Now it should always be there. Thanks to Johan (http://www.mothugg.se/) for pointing this out :)
Also fixed the way version checks are done

Added another criteria so it's possible to style odd and even numbered comments
