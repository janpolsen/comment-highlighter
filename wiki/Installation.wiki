#summary Installation and upgrading guide
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy
There isn't any difference between installing this plugin for the first time and upgrading the plugin.

  * Download the latest release [http://code.google.com/p/comment-highlighter/downloads/list here]
  * Save that file as {{{comment_highlighter.php}}} in your plugin-directory
  * Activate the plugin called *Comment Highlighter* in your admin section under Plugins
  * Start adding some "rules"
  * Add the following line to wherever define the class of your comment:
{{{
<?php if(function_exists('CommentHighlight')) CommentHighlight(); ?>
}}}
  If you use the "Connection" theme, then this line is located in the comments.php file and can look something like this:
{{{
<li class="<?php if(function_exists('CommentHighlight')) CommentHighlight(); ?>" id="comment-<?php comment_ID() ?>">
}}}
  * You might also want to add the following line to your comment header:
{{{
<?php if(function_exists('CommentHighlight')) CommentHighlight('link'); ?>
}}}

    This will make a link in you comment header which links directly to the admin interface of the plugin. The email, name, URL, comment and post ID will be pre-filled this way and you can just tag which options you want to use.

    The link will of course only be visible for the admins of the blog and not to normal readers.
